\section{CIVIS: A Community-Oriented Design in Future Smart Grids}

\begin{svgraybox}
Discuss the CIVIS project making relation to the previous theory section. 

The discussion shall not be limited to the app YouPower, but also the other efforts made around it 
(if they are related to the discussions in the previous section), e.g. the user stories, focus 
groups workshops, interviews, participatory budgeting, etc. 

Use the YouPower paper as much as possible.

\subsection{Understanding and Formulation of the Design Situation}
\begin{svgraybox}
[note by GP] Giacomo can write this part. To be expanded/integrated by all.

It will focus on CIVIS project by outlining its foundations (as fp7 R\&I project) and approach 
(interaction with local stakeholders + incremental design \& development of platform architecture). 
It will describe the inital, explicit objectives (+ simple rationale/roadmapp to achieve them) and 
it will provide an overview of the local contexts (from social, technical and energy point of view), 
in order to make clearer who are the involved stakeholders and their context.
\end{svgraybox}

Since more than two decades the ongoing and long-term energy transition shifted the energy domain
towards decentralization, distributed production and renewable sources \cite{rifkin_third_2011; 
sovacool_how_2016}. Several general and intertwined aspects contribute to this transition: 
(\textit{i}) the awareness of the inherent complexities that exist among energy systems, societies 
and the environment \cite{bulkeley_bringing_2012; umbach_global_2010}; (\textit{ii}) the
widespread diffusion of new, enhanced technologies and their hybridization with contemporary ICTs 
\cite{putrus_smart_2013; schick_innovating_2013}; (\textit{iii}) the pursuit of national and 
supranational energy policies around energy efficiency, sustainability and low carbon emissions 
\cite{da_graca_carvalho_eu_2012}; and (\textit{iv}) the emergence of new actors in the energy value 
chain, such as energy cooperatives and energy communities \cite{viardot_role_2013}, or the 
transformation of old ones, such as housing associations, and amateur energy managers 
\cite{hasselqvist_linking_2016}.

CIVIS work took place under European Union’s interest to foster energy transition by tackling the 
so called societal challenge of efficient energy. The vision of smart grids and the use of ICTs were 
the main drivers for the project's ambition to reconfigure the relationships among traditional and 
emerging actors in the energy value chain -- \textit{i.e.} distributors, producers, retailers and 
prosumers, cooperatives. In particular, CIVIS was a three year, EU 
project\footnote{\url{http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110429\_en.html}} funded under the 
\textit{FP7 Smart Cities} framework, that pursued the design, prototyping and real-life testing of 
a platform for the improvement of energy behaviours in the domestic sector. The project was 
structured around three main areas of interest -- \textit{i.e.} energy, ICT, and social innovation 
-- and organized into three broad phases that roughly overlapped with the project years and that 
ensured a close interaction with the local realities and contexts of the pilots: (\textit{i}) an 
exploratory phase, used to align CIVIS’ overarching objectives with the local contexts’ needs;
(\textit{ii}) a prototyping one, which concerned the actual design and development of the platform 
(from data monitoring devices to the front-end applications); and (\textit{iii}) a final testing 
phase which included the full scale deployment of the platform in the pilots for usage and 
assessment purposes.

Concretely, CIVIS' platform goals were to increase energy awareness, by making energy behaviours more visible, to promote
environmental and social values, to increase citizens' know-how about sustainable consumption, and to help
them in improving energy behaviours in their everyday life and together with local communities.

These interests built upon existing research and emerging trends.
For instance, research topics linking the potential of Social Networks (SNs) with that of smart grid applications 
have caught great attention in recent years, following the success of several popular platforms 
\cite{Boslet2010,Chima2011,Erickson2012,Fang2013,Huang2015}. 
Some conducted surveys to understand user needs for energy services combining SNs \cite{Silva2012}. 
Some studied connecting smart meters (or smart homes) for energy management and
sharing \cite{Ciuciu2012,Steinheimer2012}. 
Simulation models are developed to study value-added web services \cite{De-Haan2011,Lei2012,Chatzidimitriou2013} and to 
demonstrate the feasibility of coordination in meeting energy targets \cite{Worm2013,Skopik2014}.
Finally, works that visualize smart meter and appliance-level consumption data to enable comparative 
feedback among households are also increasing \cite{Petkov2011,Weiss2012,Dillahunt2014}.

However, we also wanted the overarching purpose, the underlying infrastructure and the core features of 
\textbf{CIVIS Platform} \textit{[how do we refer to it? as platform or as STS?]} to be able to integrate 
into rather different contexts, to meet diverse needs and expectations as well as to serve various 
types of user. This is why, in CIVIS, the pilot sites were understood more as sources of collaborative design and development,
rather than just as possive recipients of a technology to be tested.  

Italy and Sweden hosted two pilots each. In the former, the work focused on cooperative owned 
electricity provision. In the latter, it concerned housing cooperative's energy management in 
apartment buildings. 
In brief, the two municipalities of Storo and San Lorenzo, in Trentino Alto-Adige (a region in 
north-west Italy), included the Italian pilots. Here, two electric cooperatives, producing and 
selling 100\% renewable energy to their associate members, together with two samples of recruited 
associate member households acted as the main stakeholders. The regional distribution system 
operator (DSO), the institutional representatives of the two municipalities and two local cultural 
associations participated as stakeholders in various phases of the project, by providing knowledge 
and support for technical aspects related to energy and households engagement.
Similarly, the area of Stockholm hosted the two Swedish pilots. One involved the residential and 
central neighbourhood of Hammarby Sj\"{o}stad, which included apartment buildings owned by housing 
cooperatives\footnote{In Sweden, those who buy a home officially own the right to inhabit the estate 
and must join a corresponding \textit{housing cooperative} that owns and maintains the estates. The 
members of a cooperative annually elect a board that makes energy related decisions on behalf of 
the members.}. Recruited households from the cooperatives and cooperatives' board members acted
as key stakeholders here. \textbf{\textit{[NOTE: Do we want to include Fardala?]}} The other pilot 
concerned a townhouse area in the outskirts of Stockholm: F\aa{}rdala. In this townhouse area the 
local residents’ association and some of its member households participated to CIVIS.

Ultimately, and at the general level, the design problem areas converged on two different sets of problems
depending on the two countries. In Italy, the platform should integrate into energy communities to support
efforts of demand-side management\footnote{\textit{E.g.} Moving peaks of electricity demand, towards peaks of local energy
production or, in other words, improving the self-consumption capabilities of the electric cooperatives and
their associate members}. In Sweden, should have supported knowledge sharing about energy management practices at building
and apartment levels.

\subsection{Design Process (or participatory design?)}

\begin{svgraybox}
[note by GP] Giacomo can write most of this part. 
\end{svgraybox}

CIVIS design process was theory-driven, user-centered, collaborative and iterative. Indeed, a
literature review was carried early in the project on the intervention strategies and the social smart
grid applications for the promotion of environmental behavior change. This provided an initial, broad set
of possibilities which had been iteratively refined and improved throughout the design process.
The rationale behind this approach rested on the conviction that applying a user-centered and
collaborative design process to the development of large socio-technical system has positive
theoretical, practical and ethical implications \cite{Greenbaum1993,Boedker2004} by, for instance, increasing users engagement,
usability and integration into existing local conditions \cite{Brynjarsdottir2012,Dick2012,Pierce2012}.

\subsection{Products of the Design Process}
\begin{svgraybox}
[note by GP] Do we include here the main outputs only (I would suggest yes), or also the intermediate artifacts (mockups, user stories, etc...) of the process?
\end{svgraybox}

\subsubsection{YouPower} %or similar heading
\begin{svgraybox}
\textbf{[IMPORTANT]} THIS IS JUST A PLACEHOLDER COPIED\&PASTED FROM CONF PAPER. \textit{IT NEEDS ADJUSTMENT}
\end{svgraybox}

\noindent Given time and resource constraints, the YouPower app can not be developed all-in-one cross-platform (for phones, tablets and computers). We chose to design the front-end as a hybrid mobile phone app, i.e. its UI design has layouts that suit phone screens, %The consideration is multi-fold. 
%Western Europe has a large mobile phone internet user base\footnote{Between 2013 and 2017, the penetration rate of mobile phone internet users among mobile phone users will rise from 49.0\% to 77.8\%. See more at: \url{ http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Nearly-Half-of-Western-Europeans-Will-Use-Mobile-Web-This-Year/1010510\#sthash.AaVfsqIU.dpuf}}. Many surveys show that mobile apps have advantages such as creating deeper user engagement, easy sharing, among others\footnote{\url{https://infomedia.com/blog/the-advantages-of-mobile-apps/}, \url{https://econsultancy.com/blog/62326-85-of-consumers-favour-apps-over-mobile-websites/}}. This makes mobile app a good choice given the goal of the CIVIS platform. 
since mobile apps can be more easily transformed to web browser versions, while the reverse is more difficult.
The back-end of the YouPower platform will remain mostly the same independent of the front-end alternatives. 

\paragraph{Housing Cooperatives}
% \label{sect:brf}

This part of the YouPower app is designed for the community of housing cooperatives (\textit{Bostadsr{\"a}ttsf{\"o}rening} or \textit{Brf} in Swedish) in the Stockholm test site \cite{Hasselqvist2016}.
Similar housing ownership and management models exist in a number of EU and non-EU countries, which allow potential wider application of the design.
A housing cooperative annually elects a board which manages cooperative properties and decides on energy contracts, maintains energy systems, and proposes investments in energy efficient technologies. Since board members are volunteers who may have limited knowledge of energy or building management, this part of the app aims to support board members in energy management, in particular energy reduction actions. Cooperative members can also use the app to follow energy decisions and works of the cooperative. Additionally, the app can be of interest by building management companies working with housing cooperatives. 
The information presented in the app is visible for these user
groups and shared between housing cooperatives. This openness of energy data is key to
facilitating  users in sharing experiences relevant for taking energy reduction actions.\\

% \subsubsection{Linking energy data to energy reduction actions}
\textbf{Linking energy data to energy reduction actions}

The design links energy data with energy reduction actions taken (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure201_Actions}), both at cooperative levels, making the impact of energy actions visible to users. The energy use is divided into heating \& hot water (from district heating), and facilities electricity (in apartment buildings). Users can switch between the views per month or per year to show overall changes. %Since the energy data is shared between cooperatives there may also be privacy concerns related to opening up data of higher granularity to people outside of the own cooperative. 
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/Figure201_Actions.png}
	\caption{Heasting \& hot water use graph. Blue bars show the current year's use per month; the black line shows that of previous year. Energy reduction actions taken are mapped to the time of action and listed below.}
	\label{fig:Figure201_Actions}
\end{figure}
%
Users with editing rights, typically board members, can  add energy reduction actions that the cooperative has taken, e.g., improvement of ventilation, lighting or heating systems, 
and the related cost.
Trusted energy or building management companies can also get editing rights to add energy reduction actions they took on behalf of the cooperative. 
Added actions appear at the month when each action was taken and are listed below the graph. When clicking on an action in the list, the details of the action are shown.
% 
To make the impact of actions visible, users can compare the energy use of the viewed months to that of a previous year. This can be used e.g. by a cooperative to explore what energy reduction actions to take in the future by learning actions taken by other cooperatives and what the effects were in relation to costs.\\

% \subsubsection{Comparing housing cooperatives}
\textbf{Comparing housing cooperatives}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/Figure202_Housing_cooperatives_comparison.png}
	\caption{Map and list view of participating housing cooperatives. The energy performance of cooperatives is indicated by colour and in numbers.}
	\label{fig:Figure202_Housing_cooperatives_comparison}
\end{figure}

The cooperatives that are registered for the app are displayed in a map or list view (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure202_Housing_cooperatives_comparison}). Their icons are color coded (from red to green) based on each cooperative's energy performance, i.e. from high to low energy use per heated area, scaled according to the Swedish energy declaration for buildings\footnote{\url{http://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/energideklaration/energideklarationens-innehall-och-sammanfattning/sammanfattningen-med-energiklasser/energiklasser-fran-ag/}}. 
%  but it is calibrated to only include measured energy use for heating and hot water, which is the greatest part of the energy use. In the Swedish energy declarations, facilities electricity is also added but that often requires estimations of different factors to make the number comparable.
% 
Users can also see the energy performance as a number (in kWh/m$^2$), and the information about energy reduction actions of the cooperatives. %The number of actions is important to display to make energy reduction efforts of housing cooperatives with a high energy performance (e.g. due to poor construction of the building) visible. 
% 
During stakeholder studies, energy managers in cooperative boards stressed the importance of knowing the difference between cooperatives in order to understand the difference in their energy performance. Thus, the design also includes information about cooperatives (Figure~\ref{fig:Figure204_Neighbourhood_average}) such as the number of apartments and heated areas in a cooperative, a building's construction year, and types of ventilations (e.g. with or without heat recovery).
% 
Users can compare a cooperative's energy use per month or per year to another cooperative or to the neighborhood average. The electricity use is also displayed per area (kWh/m$^2$) to make it comparable.\\
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.42\linewidth]{img/brf.pdf}
\caption{Facilities electricity use graph. Information about housing cooperatives and actions is displayed at the top. Green bars show the housing cooperative's current year's use per month; the black line shows the average use of all housing cooperatives}
\label{fig:Figure204_Neighbourhood_average} 
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Sharing experiences}
\textbf{Sharing experiences}


A cooperative interested in taking an action may wish to know more, e.g. which contractor was chosen for an investment and why or how to get buy-in from cooperative members. The design provides commenting functions for each action added, where users can post questions and exchange experiences. The cooperatives can also add email addresses of their contact persons, which are visible on each cooperative's app page.
% 
Sharing experiences certainly also happens outside of the digital world, e.g. during meetings of cooperative boards or with local energy networks. The app aims  to support discussions and knowledge exchange also in such situations, where someone can easily demonstrate the impact of an energy investment with smart phones.


% % % ITALIAN TEST SITE
\paragraph{Demand-Side Management} 
% \label{sect:load_shifting}

This part of the YouPower app is designed for the Trento test site and can have wider application.
It provides users historical and quasi real-time consumption and production information, and facilitates users to leverage load elasticity in order to maximize self-consumption of rooftop PV productions. 
Energy data is displayed at appliances (if smart plugs are installed), household, and electricity consortia levels. %to inform users of their own energy consumption patterns and those in the neighborhood. 
%
Consumption at the appliance level enables users to gain deeper understanding of their daily actions and the resulting energy use. 
% 
Historical and current consumption and production at the household level allow users to compare those two and potentially maximize self-consumption. 
% 
Aggregated and average consumption at the consortia level informs users of neighborhood energy consumption and allows comparisons.  
% 
In addition, dynamic Time-of-Use (ToU) signals are displayed  to assist users in load shifting during their daily actions. \\

% \subsubsection{Historical and quasi real-time consumption and production} 
\textbf{Historical and quasi real-time consumption and production}

At the household level, electricity consumption and PV production levels (in W and Wh) are displayed in quasi real-time and updated for the latest six minutes\footnote{For technical reasons such as households' data transfer connections and processing time, there can be up to 2-min delay between the time of actual power measurement and the data displayed.}.
This information can also be displayed as a bar chart for a chosen period (in the past) to provide an aggregated daily overview of consumption vs. production (Figure~\ref{fig:viz_rt}). 
% 
\begin{figure}
      \begin{center}
        \begin{minipage}[htb]{0.43\linewidth}

    \caption{(a) Quasi real-time meters for household PV production; (b) Household consumption vs. production for a chosen period
}
\label{fig:viz_rt}
\end{figure}
%
When smart plugs are installed, users can view the daily electricity consumption (in Wh) of the corresponding connected appliances of their own household for a chosen period (Figure~\ref{fig:viz_hist} a). This helps them to gain better insights into the individual appliance's consumption level and its daily or seasonal patterns. 
% Selection of data ranges are mandatory for these visualizations. They must be set by users at two different places: in the ``Energy Data'' main screen for the \textit{Household} category; in the ``light-bulb'' sub-view for the \textit{Appliance} one, which is accessible from the top level bar.

}
\label{fig:viz_hist}
\end{figure}
 %
With the aggregated energy data provided by the two local electricity consortia, users can also  compare their own households' hourly consumption profiles over a chosen day to the averages and totals of the consortia to gain a sense of their relative performance compared to their peers (Figure~\ref{fig:viz_hist} b). \\

}
\label{fig:tou}
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Dynamic ToU signals} 
\textbf{Dynamic ToU signals}

Dynamic ToU signals are provided to facilitate users' self-consumption of local PV productions.
They give clear indications to encourage or discourage electricity consumption at a certain moment based on the forecasted local renewable production level calculated with open weather forecast information (in particular solar radiation data) and the local rooftop PV production capacity. 
The signals are at 3-hour intervals for the forthcoming 30 hours (Figure \ref{fig:tou} a), and are updated every 24 hours. A green smiley face signals a time slot suitable for self-consumption where the forecasted local PV production exceeds the current local consumption, while an orange frown face signals otherwise.  
% 
On a weekly basis, users get a summary of the proportion of their own household consumption that took place under green or orange ToU signals to allow them to reflect on their levels of self-consumption (Figure \ref{fig:tou} b). The same information is also provided at the consortia level to enable peer comparison. 


\paragraph{Action Suggestions}
% \label{sect:tips}

This part of the YouPower app aims to %provide actionable suggestions to 
facilitate all household members to take part in energy conservation in their busy daily life. 
% 
About fifty action suggestions are composed to provide users practical and accurate information about energy conservation. 
They include one-time actions such as ``Use energy efficient cooktops'', routine actions such as ``Line dry, air dry clothes whenever you can'', as well as in-between actions (reminders) such as ``Defrost your fridge regularly (in $x$ days)''. 
Some suggestions may seem obvious and trivial, but as indicated by literature, people often has an attitude-behavior gap when it comes to environmental issues. The goal is to facilitate the behavior change process to bridge the attitude-behavior gap, making energy conservation new habits integrated in everyday household practices. 

% \subsubsection{Free choice and self-monitoring of energy conservation actions}
\textbf{Free choice and self-monitoring of energy conservation actions}

The actions are not meant as prescriptions for what users should do but to present different ideas of what they can do (and how) in household practices. 
Users can freely choose whether (and when) to take an action and possibly reschedule and repeat the action according to the needs and interests in their own context (Figure \ref{fig:actions}). After all, users are experts of their own reality. They also have an overview of their current, pending, and completed actions.
A new action is suggested when one is completed. %After an action is in progress, the user may also postpone, abandon or indicate that the action is completed (Figure \ref{fig:actions} c). 
When an action is scheduled, its reminder is triggered by time. Users' own choices of actions and the action processes facilitate the sense of autonomy which enhances and maintains motivation \cite{Ryan2000}. \\

\end{figure}


% \subsubsection{Promoting motivation and engagement} 
\textbf{Promoting motivation and engagement}

The design uses a number of elements to promote users' motivation and engagement. 
The suggestions are tailored to the local context by local partners and focus groups. 
Each action is accompanied by a short explanation, the entailed effort and impact (on a five-point scale) and the number of users taking this action. 
The design encourages users to take small steps (and not to have too many actions at a time) and gives positive performance feedback. 
In addition, users can invite household members, %  (Figure \ref{fig:invite}), 
view and join the energy conservation actions of the whole household (Figure \ref{fig:form} a).
Users can also login with Facebook, like, comment, share actions, % (Figure \ref{fig:share}), 
give feedback (Figure \ref{fig:form} b c) and invite friends. Users are awarded with points  (displayed as Green Leaves) once they complete an action, or provide feedback or comments.
