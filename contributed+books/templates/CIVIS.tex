\section{CIVIS: A Community-Oriented Design in Future Smart Grids}

\begin{svgraybox}
Discuss the CIVIS project making relation to the previous theory section. 

The discussion shall not be limited to the app YouPower, but also the other efforts made around it (if they are related to the discussions in the previous section), e.g. the user stories, focus groups workshops, interviews, participatory budgeting, etc. 

Use the YouPower paper as much as possible.

\subsection{Understanding and Formulation of the Design Situation}
\begin{svgraybox}
[note by GP] Giacomo can write this part. To be expanded/integrated by all.

It will focus on CIVIS project by outlining its foundations (as fp7 R\&I project) and approach (interaction with local stakeholders + incremental design \& development of platform architecture). It will describe the inital, explicit objectives (+ simple rationale/roadmapp to achieve them) and it will provide an overview of the local contexts (from social, technical and energy point of view), in order to make clearer who are the involved stakeholders and their context.
