\section{CIVIS: A Community-Oriented Design in Future Smart Grids}
\label{sec:civis}

For more than two decades, energy transition has shifted the energy domain
towards decentralization and distributed renewable sources \cite{rifkin_third_2011,sovacool_how_2016}. This transition can be attributed to several intertwined facts: 
(1) the increasing awareness of the inherent complexity among energy systems, societies 
and the environment \cite{bulkeley_bringing_2012,umbach_global_2010}, (2) the
widespread diffusion of new enhanced technologies and their hybridization with modern ICT
\cite{putrus_smart_2013,schick_innovating_2013}, (3) the pursuit of national and 
supranational energy policies promoting energy efficiency, sustainability and low carbon emissions 
\cite{da_graca_carvalho_eu_2012}, and (4)~the emergence of new actors such as energy cooperatives and energy communities in the energy value chain \cite{viardot_role_2013}, and the 
transformation of traditional actors such as housing associations and amateur energy managers 
\cite{hasselqvist_linking_2016}.

The CIVIS project\footnote{\url{http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110429\_en.html}} discussed in this section as an illustration of designing a STS took place under the European Union's interest to address the societal challenges of energy efficiency. The vision of smart grids and the use of ICT are 
the main drivers for the project's ambition to reconfigure the relationships among traditional and 
emerging actors -- producers, distributors, retailers, 
prosumers and cooperatives -- in the energy value chain. CIVIS was a three-year project that pursued the design, prototyping and real-world piloting of 
a platform for the improvement of energy consumption behaviour in the domestic sector. The project was 
structured around three main areas of interest -- energy, ICT, and social innovation 
-- and was organized in three broad phases that roughly overlapped with the project years.
Each phase ensured a close interaction with the local realities and context of the pilot sites: (I) an 
exploratory phase, aligned CIVIS' overarching objectives with the local context,
(II) a prototyping phase, concerned with the design and development of the platform 
(from data monitoring devices to the front-end applications), and (III) a piloting 
phase, for the full scale deployment of the platform in the pilot sites and 
assessment.

In CIVIS, the possibility for a socio-technical approach was present by design from onset
in its formal structure and description.
The composition of the project consortium included a diversity of disciplinary profiles -- electrical engineers, computer scientists, HCI designers and sociologists -- that was necessary for tackling socio-technical challenges in the project from multiple perspectives as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:design}.

In this Section, how CIVIS adopted %is the right word?? (used?)
a socio-technical approach in practice is presented. After an overview of the design situation,
the collaborative design process and the main outcomes are discussed.
%, which allow to appreciate CIVIS STS both in its technical and social levels.  

\subsection{A Brief Overview of Design Situation}

CIVIS had the goal to increase citizens' energy awareness, promote environmental and social values, improve citizens' know-how about sustainable consumption, and to facilitate citizens to improve energy consumption behaviours in their everyday life together with local communities \cite{Huang2014,Huang2015a,Huang2016}. 
These interests were built upon prior research and socio-technical trends regarding smart grids.
For instance, research topics linking the potential of Social Networks (SNs) with that of smart grid applications 
have caught great attention in recent years, following the success of several popular platforms 
\cite{Boslet2010,Chima2011,Erickson2012,Fang2013,Huang2015}. 
Some research conducted surveys to understand user needs for energy services combining SNs \cite{Silva2012}. 
Some studied connecting smart meters (or smart homes) for energy management and
sharing \cite{Ciuciu2012,Steinheimer2012}. 
Simulation models were developed to study value-added web services \cite{De-Haan2011,Lei2012,Chatzidimitriou2013} and to 
demonstrate the feasibility of coordination in meeting energy targets \cite{Worm2013,Skopik2014}.
There has been works that visualize smart meter and appliance-level consumption data to enable comparative feedback among households \cite{Petkov2011,Weiss2012,Dillahunt2014}.

An overarching goal of the CIVIS project is to integrate the core features of CIVIS design and its underlying infrastructure into rather different contexts, to meet diverse needs and expectations as well as to serve various types of users. 
This is why the pilot sites of CIVIS -- two sites hosted in Italy and two in Sweden -- were also deemed as sources of collaborative design and development rather than merely passive recipients of a technology to be tested.  

In the two Italian pilot sites\footnote{Two municipalities of Storo and San Lorenzo in Trento, Northwest Italy.}, the focus at community level was cooperative owned electricity provision to local houses. 
Two electricity cooperatives, producing and 
selling 100\% renewable energy to their associate members, together with two samples of recruited 
associate member households acted as the main stakeholders.
The regional distribution system 
operator (DSO), the institutional representatives of the two municipalities, and two local cultural 
associations participated as stakeholders in different phases of the project, by providing knowledge 
and support for technical aspects related to energy and households engagement.
The CIVIS design in Italy needs to support energy communities in demand-side management\footnote{For example, moving peaks of electricity demand towards peaks of local energy
production or, in other words, improving the self-consumption capabilities of the electric cooperatives and
their associate members}. 

In the two Swedish pilot sites\footnote{The neighbourhoods of Hammarby Sj\"{o}stad and F\aa{}rdala in the Stockholm area.}, the focus at community level was housing cooperative's energy management in apartment buildings and town-houses.  
One site included apartment buildings owned by housing 
cooperatives\footnote{In Sweden, those who buy an apartment must join a corresponding \textit{housing cooperative} that owns and maintains the estates. The 
members of a cooperative annually elect a board that makes energy related decisions on behalf of 
the members.}. Recruited households from the cooperatives, and the cooperatives' board members acted
as key stakeholders. % Was YouPower released in Fardala at all? Do we want to explicitly talk about Fardala?
The other site was a townhouse area where the 
local residents' association and some of its member households participated to CIVIS.
The design in Sweden needs to support knowledge sharing about energy management practices at building and apartment levels.

%Ultimately, and at the general level, the design problem areas converged on two different sets of problems depending on the two countries. 

% Does this "Evaluation" belong here? I don't think so (gp)
%\paragraph{Evaluation} After a successful deployment, YouPower was evaluated in the test sites in Sweden and Italy. We collected in parallel, the data on user engagement with the app and on energy prosumption. The initial evaluation revealed how the Trentino residents engaged with a weather feature that predicts the solar energy production levels, while the Stockholm housing association managers used the community features to engage with the residents and connect with other managers. 
%
%Some of the tangible results in the Italian test site include the savings in the electricity and heating energy spent or produced \cite{civics}:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
%	\item percent	of	self-consumption	of	 the	PV	self-produced energy	 is	 increased	 for more than	50\% of the	users	comparing	to	the period before CIVIS;
%	\item electricity	consumption	from the	grid	is	reduced for the same period for	more than	50\% of the	consumers;	
%	\item 	total	 electricity	 consumption	 (including both, from	the grid	 and	the PV	 self-consumption)		is	reduced for the same period for	more than	50\% of the	consumers;	
%	\item  the users spent less than 11\% of hours in overheating their spaces.\footnote{The	heating behaviour	 of	 CIVIS	 users (control	 of	 space	 heating),	 met	 the	recommended	standard	values.}
%\end{itemize}
%
%The housing cooperatives (BRF; bostadsr\"attsf\"orening	in	Swedish) in Stockholm conducted following actions as a result of the YouPower use \cite{civics}:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
%	\item BRF	Grynnan: adjustments of	ventilation	system and	turning	off	the	outdoor	ice	melting	system (resulting in	reductions	in	heating);
%	\item BRF	 Sj\"ostaden	 1: extra	 insulation	 added	 to	 the	 roofs in	May	2015	(lead	to	a	decrease	in	heating	consumption);	 installation	 of	 heat	 recovery	 heat	 pumps	 in	 February	 2016 (lead	 to	 some	 increase	 in	 electricity	 consumption	 but	 the	 overall	savings);
%	\item BRF	\"Alven: ventilation	optimization due to lower thermal comfort,	however	the	energy	use	went	up;
%	\item BRF	 Seglatsen: installation of recovery	heat	pumps	in	 the	building (reduction in	 the	heating	consumption	by	around	60\%, and since electrcitiy consumption increased, overall savings are	about	40\%).	
%	\item BRF	 Hammarby	 Kanal:	 ventilation optimization;
%	\item BRF	 Hammarby	 Ekbacke: a goal	 based	 energy	 reduction in	a	new	business	model	for	the	housing	associations	where	 they do not	 have	 to	 pay upfront	costs	for	the energy 	actions, and then part	of	the	savings	goes to	the	 ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations)	 for	 a	 fixed	 time	 period.	
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%To assess the long term effectiveness of the CIVIS social energy intervention,  after a certain period of time, it would be beneficial to fuse the collected data from the app with those about the consumption/prosumption. 
%
%\paragraph{Limitations} The initial lack of data due to acquisition and privacy issues in the residential setting was among the main limitation in this project. We installed the IoT sensors to collect additionally needed data for using the introduced app. 

\subsection{Collaborative Design Process}

% \begin{svgraybox}
% [note by GP] Giacomo can write most of this part. 
% \end{svgraybox}

The CIVIS design process was theory-driven, human-centred, collaborative and iterative. A
literature review was carried early in the project regarding energy intervention strategies and social smart
grid applications for the promotion of environmental behaviour change. This provided an initial, broad set
of possibilities which had been iteratively assessed, refined and improved throughout the design process with the collaboration and participation of basically all stakeholders affected by it.
% 
The rationale behind this approach rested on the conviction that applying a human-centred and
collaborative design process to the development of large STS has positive
theoretical, practical and ethical implications \cite{Greenbaum1993,Boedker2004} by, for instance, increasing users engagement,
usability and integration into existing local conditions \cite{Brynjarsdottir2012,Dick2012,Pierce2012}.
% 
Along the three project years, the process unfolded as a complex and articulated network of meetings and artefacts
which strived to align the interests of different stakeholders involved, from porject partners to
local stakeholders and end-users. The project team organized brainstorming sessions and design workshops, and run exploratory and evaluation focus groups with end-users in the test sites.
Due to limited space, the main aspects of the process are summarized as follows. Interested readers can refer to
\cite{poderi_disentangling_2017} for a detailed study on how the process shaped the main
outcomes of CIVIS. % Do we want to refer to CIVIS as the project, or CIVIS platform or avoid alltogether to refer to it as an entity (once we have introduced it)


\runinhead{User Stories} 
%\subsubsection{User stories}
We adopted the tool of user stories \cite{Kankainen2012} from Software Engineering and adapted it to the socio-technical context of the project. The user stories crossed CIVIS both horizontally (to the
scope of the work packages) and vertically (to the needs of the two countries). Each user
story identified a realistic scenario, a main scope of the energy intervention, the supporting ICT tools,
and the central social dynamics. During the three years, we drafted, refined, merged, abandoned and
finalized them as part of our constant work of alignment and negotiation. We discussed them in internal
workshops, round-tables with stakeholders, and focus-groups with participant end-users; we circulated
them to software engineers and platform designers; we publicly presented them for feedback and used them
as frames for collaborative workshops. They represented evolving artefacts that we consolidated in formal
versions at the end of every year of activity.

}
\label{fig:stkh_meetings}
\end{figure}
%

These were held primarily at the level of the pilot sites, by involving CIVIS technical figures and the
key local energy stakeholders. Meetings were held quarterly, although at the project's onset and during
the most intense `design phase' of the work, they occurred more frequently.
% 
These meetings proved helpful for agreeing on the project overarching objectives at the local levels, but also
for understanding the feasibility and rationality of the choices for the social and technical aspects of the platform.
For instance, it required long discussions and negotiation about the identification and selection of the energy monitoring devices to be installed in
participants households for enabling the proper granularity and availability of energy data. 
The suitability of these devices could not be assessed at a technical level only (regarding cost/efficiency, type of data,
reliability and protocols).
The typology of end-users and the housing conditions\footnote{In italy, participants were older and less tech-savy, living in independent, large houses; while in Sweden participants were relatively young and more tech-savy, but living in smaller apartments in residential buildings.}
also played an important role. 

%
% Another example that can be brought up relate to the availability of DSO data, which took a long time to be clarified and it also influenced/related a lot with the
% possible/desired features of the platform.

These activities involved potential and actual participating household members, recruited for the project, and they
were run as collective discussions. Usually they lasted around two hours and included between six to eight discussants.
In case of the exploratory meetings, the scope of the discussion was intentionally broad and it aimed at revealing possible latent
needs or expectations, as well as discussing explicit ones. More importantly these were used to get first-hand knowledge
about the social and cultural environment where the platform was to be deployed. On the contrary, the evaluation discussions
had more specific focuses and involved concrete artefacts (e.g. an interface mock-up or app prototype)
as a basis.
% 
For instance, exploratory meetings helped us put in due perspective some of the features we initially taught
would be welcomed by end-users, such as ``sharing'' of energy performances or measurements typical of social network platforms.
In our contexts, it was both difficult to grasp the meaning of such a feature, but it also raised
 concerns to privacy. At the same time, the intermediate evaluation activities allowed us to spot
limitations of our data visualizations (e.g. oversimplifications of energy data through a certain type of charts),
and of the engagement and participatory process itself\footnote{A study of the end-users appreciation of the engagement and participatory process in the Italian pilot sites
is published in \cite{capaccioli_exploring_2017}.}
(e.g. expectation of more frequent interactions with the project).

    on user requirements; (b) One of the group outcomes for mapping energy consumption habits at home. 
}
\label{fig:workshops}
\end{figure}

These workshops involved concrete, hands-on activities done primarily with participant household members.
Occasionally a few workshops took place among project partners or had a broader target.
As it is typical of collaborative design approaches we adopted different workshop methodologies (\textit{e.g.} brainstorming, future scenarios,
collages, usage simulation) to suit diverse needs in the different phases of CIVIS.
Ultimately, they allowed to identify the end-user requirements\footnote{A preliminary analysis of these emerging requirements in the Italian pilots
is presented in \cite{capaccioli_participatory_2016}.} for the platform front-end as well as
improving and tailoring the interface layout.
% 
For instance, for the module of \textit{Action suggestions}, the workshops were relevant for adjusting the various
tips for energy conservation to the local contexts of use. These were in fact quite different between the two countries,
 and certain tips had no meaning when delivered to one or another country or they needed a different
 rationale for their presentation.\\
 
In general, a constant work of alignment took place at a high level of abstraction mainly thanks to
the use of user stories as key boundary object among stakeholders,
expertises and local contexts.
At a more concrete level, a set of platform features was prototyped in simple mock-ups
and also used as a basis for discussion. These underwent iterative rapid prototyping which
produced wireframes as better visual guides that could be more effectively communicated to end-users.
Prior and after each iteration, exploratory activities on how to proceed and evaluation sessions for their outcomes took place in different venues and with different stakeholders.
TABLE X provide a brief overview on the relationships among the various activities of the collaborative design process and their influence on CIVIS platform design viewed through the perspective of a socio-technical approach.

Another main outcome of the design process, which also reflects the potential richness of designing for large-scale STSs, rests at the level of community engagement. %The approaches to the use, adoption and appropriation of the platform resulted for the pilots in the two countries. % I don't understand this sentence
The ambition to foster energy behaviour change at the collective level of communities (or neighbourhoods),
instead of simply aiming for technology adoption at individual level, made it clear the need to design for
engagement.
% 
In the two national contexts, two different engagement processes accompanied the deployment and testing of the technology. They tried to stimulate the emergence of the social dynamics connected to the change of energy behaviour. 

In Italy, a full fledged process named \textit{Participatory Energy Budgeting} (PEB) \cite{capaccioli_exploring_2017,capaccioli_exploring_2016}
was run with the twofold goal of subsidizing people's efforts in demand-side management
and empowering them to handle their achievements in a collective and transparent way.
%
PEB is a policy frame that relies on a call for tender that
defines: the energy budget to be administered;
the criteria and procedures to submit proposals for funds request; the procedures
to evaluate, select and award the winning proposals; and a roadmap for the process development. 
Grounded on the community funds model of participatory budgeting \cite{Ganuza2012,Sintomer2008},
PEB promoted engagement and allowed collective decision
making around the management and allocation of ``energy bonus'', which could be
collected through the collective effort of shifting electric energy demand
towards local production peaks.
% 
The PEB and the demand-side management module of YouPower
were thought and designed to act in synergy and ``reinforce'' each other.
%Such bonuses are linked to the community performances related to demand-side management:
The more people consumed energy during peaks of local production -- foretold and displayed
with ``green smileys'' in YouPower -- the more the energy bonuses grew.

PEB can be considered a main outcome of the design process in the Italian sites, because 
the idea to manage collectively the energy savings emerged during the first exploratory focus groups,
and throughout the fist two project years, such idea has been refined and negotiated into
a full-fledged policy frame, with the participation of recruited households and the endorsement
of the electric consortia. For instance, while the latter vouched for the legitimacy of the process
and made the ``energy bonus'' practically available, the former defined key aspects of PEB frame such as the criteria for eligibility and those ones for final evaluation and award.  


% TEXT BY HANNA H
In Sweden, the engagement work and app design aimed to complement the already existing community efforts to address energy issues. Meetings were arranged with housing cooperative representatives to discuss experiences of energy reduction actions and how those could be shared through the Youpower app. Furthermore, the app was used as a probe to discuss housing cooperative energy management with other stakeholders who may influence housing cooperative energy use, such as building managers, energy providers, and energy advisers. These stakeholders were already working with housing cooperatives and many had ambitions of supporting housing cooperatives in reducing energy use. By engaging with these stakeholders and learning about their processes and goals, we identified opportunities for the Youpower app to be used jointly by these stakeholders and housing cooperatives to support energy improvement work.
