\section{CIVIS: A Community-Oriented Design in Future Smart Grids}

\begin{svgraybox}
Discuss the CIVIS project making relation to the previous theory section. 

The discussion shall not be limited to the app YouPower, but also the other efforts made around it (if they are related to the discussions in the previous section), e.g. the user stories, focus groups workshops, interviews, participatory budgeting, etc. 

Use the YouPower paper as much as possible.

CIVIS was a three year, EU project\footnote{\url{http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110429\_en.html}} funded under the \textit{FP7 Smart Cities} framework, that pursued the design,
prototyping and real-life testing of a platform for the improvement of energy behaviours in the domestic sector. The project was structured around three main areas
of interest – \textit{i.e.} energy, ICT, social innovation and business – and organized into three broad phases that roughly
overlapped with the project years and that ensured a close interaction with the local realities and contexts of
the pilots: (\textit{i}) an exploratory one, used to align CIVIS’ overarching objectives with the local contexts’ needs;
(\textit{ii}) a prototyping one, which concerned the actual design and development of the platform (from data monitoring devices to the
front-end applications); and (\textit{iii}) a final testing phase which included the full scale deployment of the platform in the pilots for usage and assessment purposes.

Italy and Sweden hosted two pilots each, understood here as \textit{DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY PILOT}.

The two municipality areas of Storo and San Lorenzo in Trentino Alto-Adige (a region in north-west Italy) included the
Italian pilots. Here, two electric cooperatives, producing and selling 100\% renewable energy
to their associate members acted as the main stakeholders. The regional distribution system operator (DSO),
the institutional representatives of the two municipalities and two local cultural associations participated as
stakeholders in various phases of the project, by providing knowledge and support for technical aspects related
to energy and households engagement. Ultimately, in the Italian pilots the platform materialized as a web-app
designed to support household members in shifting their consumption loads towards timeslots characterized by high
local production. Households engagement was subsidized by the availability of an `energy budget' to be managed
and allocated collectively at the end of the trial period.

\textbf{TO BE FIXED:} The two pilots in Sweden took place in the area of Stockholm. One involved the residential and central neighbourhood
of Hammarby Sj\"{o}stad, which includes mainly apartment buildings owned by housing cooperatives. Key stakeholders in the
housing cooperative neighborhood were housing cooperative board members and households from the cooperatives. The other
one concerned a townhouse area in the outskirts of Stockholm.  We provided them with a web app aimed at facilitating both
building and household-level energy reduction actions. In the townhouse area we collaborated with the local residents’ association
and its member households. Sensors were installed that enabled the participating households to monitor and control indoor
temperature and to detect and receive feedback on appliance level electricity use.

\subsection{Understanding and Formulation of the Design Situation}
\begin{svgraybox}
[note by GP] Giacomo can write this part. To be expanded/integrated by all.

It will focus on CIVIS project by outlining its foundations (as fp7 R\&I project) and approach (interaction with local stakeholders + incremental design \& development of platform architecture). It will describe the inital, explicit objectives (+ simple rationale/roadmapp to achieve them) and it will provide an overview of the local contexts (from social, technical and energy point of view), in order to make clearer who are the involved stakeholders and their context.

Since more than two decades the ongoing and long-term energy transition process is shifting the energy domain
towards decentralization, distributed production and renewable sources \cite{rifkin_third_2011; sovacool_how_2016}.
Several general and intertwined aspects contribute to this transition: (\textit{i}) the awareness of the inherent complexities
that exist among energy systems, societies and the environment \cite{bulkeley_bringing_2012; umbach_global_2010}; (\textit{ii}) the
widespread diffusion of new, enhanced technologies and their hybridization with contemporary ICTs \cite{putrus_smart_2013; schick_innovating_2013};
(\textit{iii}) the pursuit of national and supranational energy policies around energy efficiency, sustainability and low carbon emissions \cite{da_graca_carvalho_eu_2012};
and (\textit{iv}) the emergence of new actors in the energy value chain, such as energy cooperatives and
energy communities \cite{viardot_role_2013}, or the transformation of old ones, such as housing associations,
and amateur energy managers \cite{hasselqvist_linking_2016}.
