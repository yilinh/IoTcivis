\abstract*{In traditional engineering, technologies are viewed as the central piece of the engineering design, where the physical world consists of a large number of diverse technological artifacts. The real world, however, also comprises a huge amount of social components -- people, communities, institutions, regulations and everything that exists in the human mind -- that have shaped and been shaped by the technical components. Smart urban ecosystems are examples of such large-scale socio-technical systems that rely on technologies, particularly IoT, within a complex social context where the technologies are embedded. Despite that the two aspects are deeply intertwined, designing applications that embed IoT in large-scale socio-technical systems is slowly transitioning from a traditional engineering approach towards a socio-technical approach. The latter has not yet entered the mainstream of design practice. In this chapter, we present our experience of adopting a socio-technical approach in designing a community-oriented smart grid user application. The challenges, implications and lessons learned are discussed. The chapter is concluded by offering a set of good design principles derived from this experience, which are also relevant to the design of other smart urban ecosystems.}
