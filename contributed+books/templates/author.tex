\abstract*{In traditional engineering, technologies are viewed as the central piece of the engineering design, where the physical world consists of a large number of diverse technological artifacts. The real world, however, also comprises a huge amount of social components -- people, communities, institutions, regulations and everything that exists in the human mind -- that have shaped and been shaped by the technical components. Smart urban ecosystems are examples of such large-scale socio-technical systems that rely on technologies, particularly IoT, within a complex social context where the technologies are embedded. Despite that the two aspects are deeply intertwined, designing applications that embed IoT in large-scale socio-technical systems is slowly transitioning from a traditional engineering approach towards a socio-technical approach. The latter has not yet entered the mainstream of design practice. In this chapter, we present our experience of adopting a socio-technical approach in designing a community-oriented smart grid user application. The challenges, implications and lessons learned are discussed. The chapter is concluded by offering a set of good design principles derived from this experience, which are also relevant to the design of other smart urban ecosystems.}

% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the option graphics use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
%\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}
