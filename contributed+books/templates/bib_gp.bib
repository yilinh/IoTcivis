	abstract = {Thanks to renewable energies the decentralized energy system model is becoming more relevant in the production and distribution of energy. The scenario is important in order to achieve a successful energy transition. This paper presents a reflection on the ongoing experience of infrastructuring a sociotechnical system in which local communities can manage renewable energies as a Common Pool Resources. We explore how to create a space for citizens' participation in a continuous process of design for energy management. Objectives of the paper are: i) to clarify how Participatory Design could support the sustainability and the effectiveness of an alternative, ii) to present an experimentation with renewable energy as CPR as an alternative model to the actual vision of the energy system. Preliminary results reported in this paper suggest that a Participatory Design process can be valuable for communities in order to establish new energy management models.},

There is a recursivity (with regards to the issue of sustainability) in this paper: It is both the context (energy sustainability) and the outcome (the alternative - community/commons-based model - has to be sustainable)
It addresses energy sustainability as main problem domain and it suggests a bottom-up approach, grounded on real, pre-existent social relationship and cultural understanding of energy, as the right level to tackle the problem.
It proposes a PD approach as a means to infrastructure the proper level of understanding of the (energy) problem and the envisioning of adequate solutions. When these are fostered and nurtured with the due level of ownership and sense of belonging they might get closer to something such as a commons.

DEFINITION (is Sust. defined or clearly explained? Is it referenced)?
Sustainability is NOT defined.
Sust. is referenced
 
LINK TO PAPER OBJECTIVES (How does sust related to the explicit objectives of the paper?)
Objective of the paper are:

 i)  to  clarify  how  Participatory  Design  could  support the  sustainability  and  the  effectiveness  of  an  alternative,  ii)  to present an experimentation with renewable energy as CPR as an alternative  model  to  the  actual  vision  of  the  energy  system. (p9)

 
The paper addresses explicitly energy sustainability as problem domain. Also in the paper they clarify how, PD and the community/commons - cpr approach - might be a way to infrastructure a sustainable solution.
 
CONCRETE TARGET (what has to be sustainable/sustained?)
Twofold meaning:
- Energy use has to be sustainable
- The alternative (community/project/process/commons) have to be sustainable
TARGET TYPE (desired outcome of design? quality of process? barier to intervention? problem to be solved?)
Sustainability is both
- the context/problem domain for PD to make an intervention (this links with the sustainability science domain)
- the desired characteristic of the solution (commons have to be sustainable): the alternative developed thanks to PD approach, has to be sustainable
 
GENERAL
There is a recursivity (with regards to the issue of sustainability) in this paper.
It addresses energy sustainability as main problem domain and it suggests a bottom-up approach, grounded on real, pre-existent social relationship and cultural understanding of energy, as the right level to tackle the problem.
It proposes a PD approach as a means to infrastructure the proper level of understanding of the (energy) problem and envisioning of acceptable solutions. When these are fostered and nurtured with the due level of ownership and sense of belonging they might get closer to something such as a commons.},

	abstract = {This exploratory paper reflects on the activities of an European project that explores novel forms of citizens engagement with the twofold objective of exploring alternative governance approaches to renewable energy sources and of reducing and optimizing energy consumption. This exploratory vision is inquired through the use of ICTs tools in connection with a new deliberative process built upon the participatory budgeting model. The paper describes the energy budgeting framework and provides empirical insights grounded on its ongoing implementation and trialing. We provide two main points of discussion regarding social acceptance of technology and the shifting from a monetary budget to a energy one.},

	abstract = {The ethical and sustainable production and consumption of energy are becoming increasingly important with the ongoing transformation and decentralization of the energy system. For other kinds of goods and commodities ethical consumption have direct implications for, and the participation of, informed citizens. Due to its intangibility, energy lacks the same levels of reflection and intervention by citizens and those aspects are yet to be fully explored in practice.
This paper contributes to the understanding of how energy justice might be approached. We reflect on an empirical experience of participatory energy budgeting, a process aimed at determining how to redistribute a share of energy linked to collective virtuous consumption behaviors.
We analyze through a qualitative thematic analysis how participants make sense of the participatory energy budgeting process and the emerged dynamics within the local communities and how this process can strive to reconfigure the relationship among civil society, the energy sector and politics, in order to remediate injustices. We highlight how the construction-in-practice of energy justice in a local community might be closely linked to issues such as the form of energy governance that allows for the participation of citizens and the accountability of the process, policies and technological limitations.},

	abstract = {Participatory Design has recently seen growing interest in developing critical forms of reflexivity able to disentangle the complexity of participatory ensembles. This article makes a methodological contribution to this endeavour. Drawing on socio-cognitive analyses of collaborative design, it proposes the frame of ‘interaction spaces’ as a scaffolding tool for conducting retrospective analyses of participatory design processes. The paper uses the ‘interaction spaces’ frame to analyse the three years of collaborative activities of the CIVIS Project. Through a longitudinal and multi-dimensional account of participatory dynamics involved in the designing, prototyping and testing of an IT platform for home energy management, the frame evidences how participatory configurations evolve over time; it makes clearer the characteristics of participation as partial and overtaken; and it identifies moments of cross-participation as potential basis for the boundary-spanning of design issues.},
